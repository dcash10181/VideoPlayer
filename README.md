# VideoPlayer

1. Create a basic iOS project using AVPlayer to fetch and play this URL: https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8
Do not use any of the Apple player view controllers

2. Do not spend any time on UI work. Play buttons etc are not required. You can play the URL upon startup

3. Add the ability to print to the console when playback starts and stops

4. Add the ability to print to the console the current playhead position every 0.5 seconds

5. Create a github repo and upload the project

6. Do not spend more than a day maximum on this. The coding should be easy, it should take a few hours to understand how AVPlayer works
